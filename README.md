# Genetic-Algorithm
Simple genetic algorithm that solves Travelling salesman problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

To run simulation, run Evolution.py script.
Change variables in Globals.py to configure simulation.


This code was written long time ago, I would rework it if I had time right now, but I don't. Readability is not great, but I added few comments to hopefully improve it. Also, running simulation and showing animation of this simulation could be done better, but again, I don't have time to fix it now.
